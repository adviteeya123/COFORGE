# COFORGE

MySQL and Python can be used together to perform a variety of data-related tasks. Here are some common use cases for collaborating between MySQL and Python:

1. Connecting to MySQL using Python: Python has several libraries that can be used to connect to a MySQL database, including mysql-connector-python, pymysql, and pyodbc.
2. Querying data from MySQL using Python: Once you've connected to your MySQL database using Python, you can execute queries to retrieve data.
3. Modifying data in MySQL using Python: You can use Python to modify data in your MySQL database by executing SQL queries.
4. Loading data from Python to MySQL: You can use Python to load data from external sources (e.g. CSV files) into MySQL.
5. Overall, the combination of MySQL and Python provides a powerful set of tools for managing data.


# Types of SQL commands

In SQL, there are several types of commands that can be used to interact with a database. Here are some commonly used types of SQL commands:
1.	Data Manipulation Language (DML) commands:
o	SELECT: Retrieves data from one or more database tables.
o	INSERT: Inserts new rows of data into a table.
o	UPDATE: Modifies existing data in a table.
o	DELETE: Removes rows of data from a table.
2.	Data Definition Language (DDL) commands:

o	CREATE: Creates a new database, table, view, index, or other database objects.
o	ALTER: Modifies the structure of an existing database object, such as a table.
o	DROP: Deletes an existing database object, such as a table or view.
o	TRUNCATE: Removes all data from a table, but keeps the table structure intact.

3.	Data Control Language (DCL) commands:
o	GRANT: Provides user access privileges to database objects.
o	REVOKE: Revokes user access privileges from database objects.

4.	Transaction Control commands:
o	COMMIT: Saves all changes made within a transaction.
o	ROLLBACK: Undoes all changes made within a transaction.
o	SAVEPOINT: Sets a point within a transaction to which you can roll back.

5.	Data Query Language (DQL) commands:
o	SELECT: Retrieves data from one or more database tables.
o	JOIN: Combines rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them.

These are some of the common types of SQL commands. The specific commands available may vary depending on the SQL database management system (DBMS) you are using, as different DBMSs may have their own extensions and variations.
